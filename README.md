## Overview

I've been helping my client Dana design a responsive, dynamic website covering UFO sighting data. Initially, we designed the site to allow visitors to search sighting information by date. After mulling the website design over, Dana asked if it would be possible to add additional filters based on the other data points in the sightings - search criteria by City, State, Country, and finally by the Shape of the UFO itself. Our end goal is to have a crisp, professional website where visitors can search by single or multiple criteria to find the exact sighting they seek.
